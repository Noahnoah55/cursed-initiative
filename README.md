# cursed-initiative
An initiative tracker for role playing games built with python and curses

This is a personal use tool for when I run games of CyberPunk RED and need to keep track of combat. Also a quick exercise to get me used to the Python curses library.

The initial commit contains most of the core features I need, any future updates will probably be UI tweaks and other minor changes.

# intallation and use

Development is done on python 3.4.3, but this program is simple enough that I've had it run fine on python 2 before without any changes.

Simply download the source and run 'python main.py' press '?' while the program is running for a help screen to run through the controls
